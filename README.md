# Triple Peaks Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the fulltime Software Engineering program at TripleTen. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM file structure
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

The project could include an additional menu card with a list of teas in the coffee shop's collection. The option to place orders for pick up or delivery via another service would be a big lift in business value for the shop.
